# Family farm website

Family farm website - Wordpress Theme created from scratch  

[Demo link](http://a95211av.beget.tech/)  

## Project decription

This site was made to meet the real needs of picking orders for one my ex-coworker. Currently she's collecting orders sending emails by-weekly, directly to her clients.
I decided to make a service that would make communication with customers easier, while the method of collecting orders, in fact, remained familiar - Google Sheets.

As a site CMS I choose WordPress (~~for getting new skills, of course~~) and for sending orders - Contacn Form 7 and CF7 Google Sheet Connector plugins.  

By the way, you can test service functionality by ordering something, and checking Google Sheets table.
